# SecureHealth

This project was made by Ansh Mehta, Soham Dave and Janvi Desai in TSEC Codestorm, an online 72-hour hackathon organized by Thadomal Sahani College of Engineering.

The project is a Blockchain-based Health-care system, providing a portal for patients and doctors to securely share data on the Web.
